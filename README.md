# react-jest-testing
In this exercise I learned how to test react apps using Jest. 


I did this exercise as part of my studies with React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux) by Maximillian Schwarzmuller
https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/

In this exercise I learned and practiced: 
- understanding different kinds of Tests- Unit, Integration, End-to-End
- running unit tests on React apps with Jest
- writing Unit Tests and grouping them in Test Suites
- testing User Interaction and State
- testing Connected Components
- testing Asynchronous Code
- working with Mocks


To run locally: 
- Download the project files into a local folder 
- Navigate into this project folder in the terminal 
- In terminal type 'npm install' . This will install the node modules packages and recreates the node_modules folder. 
- In terminal type 'npm start' to start the server and open the project in your browser.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74827533/170243730-24f88131-fa7c-4574-aded-69f9b90c4fa3.png)
